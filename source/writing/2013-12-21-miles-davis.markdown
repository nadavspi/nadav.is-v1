One of our assignments at [Patterns](http://patterns.co) was to talk about three people we admire and to explain what makes them great. I talked about [Miles Davis][7001-001], [Billy Strayhorn][7001-002], and [Beethoven][7001-003].

The first person that popped into my head was Miles Davis, but I thought “I can’t talk about Miles Davis—he’s Miles Davis!” What could be more stereotypical than me talking about Miles? I didn’t think everyone in the group—designers, entrepreneurs, and film people—wanted to hear me blabber about Jazz for a week, so I tried to think of some people that weren’t musicians. I couldn’t. I buried my hesitations and decided to talk about Miles Davis anyway—he’s the obvious choice for a reason. 

I started by sharing all of this with the group. I pulled up a [Google Image Search for Miles][google-image] on the TV, looked at it for a few seconds, and said: “Just look at this motherfucker. He epitomizes cool.” I’ll admit that although I was mostly speaking extemporaneously, I had planned that move.

I told them that when Miles first moved to New York City, he looked for the baddest cat around, which at that time was Charlie Parker who created a style of Jazz called [bebop](!wiki). Miles started to hang out with Bird, and ended up playing in his group—and probably picking up the heroin addiction from him too, as many probably did. 

I explained that Miles knew how to pick the right people for whatever idea he had in his head, and then knew to let them do their thing without much instruction. I like this idea of picking the right people and then supporting them in doing what they do instead of trying to fit them into your mold. 

I ruminated that because Miles was so understated—personally and musically—whenever he *did* say something, it made a lasting impression. Everyone that ever played with Miles has an impression of his raspy voice and coarse language. I shared what Miles told John Coltrane when Trane was seeking and would go on and on in his solos. 

I gave some examples of the way Miles changed the music: the cool jazz aesthetic in the wake of the fast, frantic style of bebop. I explained that the first quintet still defines the repertoire of straight ahead jazz today, and that the second quintet is probably more influential than any other group on the way we play today, 50 years later.

I explained how, when electric music and rock &lsquo;n’ roll became popular in the late 60s, Miles embraced it—to the dismay of his bandmates—and made wild, funky electric music. This was especially relevant for Patterns as we had been exploring the effect of technology on the creative fields. 

I was encouraged to see people around me nodding in interest and recognition as I talked about Jazz. I shared my worry about mythologizing our heroes. I love Miles for his creative output, not for his personality. He was a promiscuous drug addict and often took credit for tunes he didn’t write. I’m interested in the biographies of artists I admire, but I’m a lot more interested in their work.(Sometimes it’s better not to know. If I decided to boycott anti-semitic artists, for example, I’d be trouble.)
