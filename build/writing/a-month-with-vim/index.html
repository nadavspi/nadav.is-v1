    <p>Since starting at <a href="http://somethingdigital.com">SD</a> in February, I’ve been doing a lot of work on virtual machines or remote servers. I haven’t spent this much time in the command line since I was compiling my own linux kernels and fucking up grub configs as an early teen, and it’s a lot of fun. Because many of these machines don’t have an editor other than Vim and setting up SFTP for every project in Sublime Text is a pain, I decided it was time to learn Vim. Before I started, I know how to go into insert mode and how to save and quit. That’s it. As a geek, I continually hack and refine my environment and this seemed like an obvious place for improvement. So for the past month, I’ve been using Vim exclusively. And I’ve been going deep.</p>

<p>My favorite thing about Vim (other than street cred from my fellow nerds) is that it’s a language that builds upon itself. Once I learn a word, I can string it together with the ones I already know to form sentences. For instance, hitting <em>j</em> moves the cursor down one line. Putting a number in front of any command repeats it that many times, so <em>3j</em> moves the cursor down three lines. Once I learn that <em>d</em> is for delete, I can do <em>d3j</em> to delete three lines down. As soon as I know that <em>f</em> finds the specified character in the line, I also know how to delete everything until the next semicolon in the line by doing <em>df;</em>, and so on. </p>

<p>The logic of Vim as a language is very appealing and works with the way I think. As a front end dev, being able to change the contents of an HTML tag or a string in quotes in a couple of keystrokes is awesome. Being able to expand a line of HTML or CSS using two keystrokes with <a href="https://github.com/AndrewRadev/splitjoin.vim">splitjoin.vim</a> is borderline mindblowing. </p>

<p>This leads me to another reason I’m digging Vim: its extensibility and plugin ecosystem. This is familiar from using Sublime Text, which has many awesome plugins as well. What makes it extra appealing with Vim is that by bringing <a href="https://github.com/nadavspi/dotfiles/blob/master/vimrc">my vimrc</a> with me, I can feel at home on any random machine I have to work on.</p>

<p>There are tons of <a href="http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/09/coming-home-to-vim/">great</a> <a href="http://www.danielmiessler.com/study/vim/">articles</a> and even <a href="https://leanpub.com/painless_vim">some</a> <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/dnvim/practical-vim">books</a> about Vim that I’ve been referencing as I go, but the main thing has been to just throw myself into it. It’s been fun and rewarding so far, and has led some other geekery like <a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/">tmux</a> and learning more about <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">zsh</a>, but I’ll save those for another day. </p>
